I'm developing this game engine to get a better grasp at the innter workings of games. I'm focusing on keeping the architecture clean and open to changes, improvements and other additions.

I have started with DirectX11 but I've since moved on to implementing a Vulkan backend. The engine is decoupled from the actual API via an abstraction layer.
I'm also excited to get started on more complex rendering systems and physics simulations.

I'm keeping a blog on [leonstier.com](https://leonstier.com/engine/index.html) where I keep tabs on the details.
