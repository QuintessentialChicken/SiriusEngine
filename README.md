I'm developing this game engine to get a better grasp at the innter workings of games. I'm focusing on keeping the architecture clean and open to changes, improvements and other additions.

Right now I'm using DirectX, but I'm planning to move on to Vulkan once I have a good structure in place.

I'm also excited to get started on more complex rendering systems and physics simulations.
